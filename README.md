StudyBookos
===========

StudyBooks is a small web platform that stores multiple books with different kinds of content. It is intended to be easy and to support people by organizing their notes.

Technologies
------------

The project uses PHP as a server-side scripting language and on the client side JavaScript, although it should also work with pure HTML&CSS. Enhanced features like video, audio and vector graphics will be using HTML5 technologies.

Development Status
------------------

Still working on framework (basic MVC, OO-SQL wrapper, multi-language support, configuration, user management), but that will be finished soon. The basic concepts for content tree are adopted in the data base structure.
